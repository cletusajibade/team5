## Build and Run
*In order to run this project, you will need to have a java compiler installer OR IntelliJ (IDE we have chosen to use) as well as a Java Development Kit (JDK)*

For this project, we have decided to use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to create a Java project and to run our program.

You can directly create an IntelliJ Java project from Github and then navigate to the [main class file](team5/org/team5/app/main/Main.java) and run the main function.
